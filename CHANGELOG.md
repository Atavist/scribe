# 1.3.0

Introduces a new time-based undo manager and improvements to allow multiple Scribe instances to share or have a separate undo manager. Thanks to [Abdulrahman Alsaleh](https://github.com/aaalsaleh) for providing the code and spending a lot of time working with us on the tests.

# 1.2.11

Added configuration for removing `scribe.undoManager`

# 1.2.10

Bugfixes for selections that are 'reversed' (i.e. selected from right to left) from [Deains](https://github.com/deains). Thanks

# 1.2.9

Clarifies the use of nodeName in the Command implementation. Thanks [Christopher Liu](https://github.com/christopherliu)

# 1.2.8

Event waterfall / [Event Namespacing](https://github.com/guardian/scribe/pull/337)

# 1.2.7

ShadowDOM fixes for Chrome from [ShaunNetherby](https://github.com/shaunnetherby), thanks

# 1.2.5

IE11 compatiability changes from [Deains](https://github.com/deains), thank you

# 1.2.4

Changes the way that root nodes are detected, the code now uses the element that the Scribe instance is bound to rather than looking for contenteditable attributes.

# 1.2.3

Changes the EventEmitter to store callbacks in sets to enforce uniqueness and avoid duplicate calls

# 1.2.1

Fixes a typo with the use of options in the default command patches that was breaking Browserify

# 1.2.0

Allows the default command patches to be over-ridden in the options. This will allow users to customise what gets loaded to address issues like [the behaviour of the bold patch](https://github.com/guardian/scribe/pull/250) where the default behaviour is not what is required.

# 1.1.0

Introduces [ImmutableJS](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js) (which is also exposed via scribe.immutable) and starts to convert some the internal workings of Scribe to use immutable data structures.

Adds 55K of needless bloat according to @theefer but I am heartless and laugh at his tears.

# 1.0.0

This is a non-backwards compatible change as we are removing the use of Scribe Common. The Node and Element apis that were available in that project are now exposed via the *scribe* object itself (`scribe.node` and `scribe.element`).

Existing plugins should not break for this release but please re-write your plugins if you use 1.0.0 as a dependency.
